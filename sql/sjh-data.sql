If you are seeking to live a life of meaning and purpose, embodying your values and living your highest potential, you might find that the mainstream stories that surround you are guiding you in the opposite direction.\r\n\r\n<strong>Stories are powerful because they speak directly to our subconscious mind</strong> and help us define what is possible.

Where were the stories celebrating the limitless potential I was glimpsing inside?\r\n\r\n<strong>After some searching I discovered mythology,</strong> and found that human beings weren\'t as strange as I had thought. We had always had stories about the inner life, and those stories had often been central to the cultures that had come before us. What was strange was the way the modern world had turned its back on all that.\r\n\r\n<strong>I spent several years studying European folktales</strong> and became a storyteller. I wanted to learn in-depth the ways we used to enchant one another with stories. I gave over two thousand storytelling performances in hundreds of schools throughout England. But then, something really unexpected happened...\r\n\r\n<strong>The stories started coming by themselves!</strong> As I saw vivid scenes progressing in my mind\'s eye, and heard verbal cues from my inner voice, new stories that were both magical and surprising would come tumbling out of me! Although I never knew what was coming next, I was amazed to find that the stories were well structured and had a beautiful and uplifting teaching.\r\n\r\n<strong>Telling these stories is like standing at the edge of a mysterious ocean</strong> of wonder and depth and great beauty. I throw open my arms and wait, and the stories that come are utterly unknown to me. My job is only to find the words for what I\'m receiving.\r\n\r\n<strong>I\'ve recorded thousands of these \"intuitive stories\" in the last 20 years.</strong> I\'ve told them to my own kids, and for audiences of both adults and children in many diverse settings. The stories adapt to whoever is listening, and respond to the needs that are present, in a way that continues to amaze me.\r\n\r\n<strong>In 2010 I began teaching Intuitive Storytelling,</strong> and was surprised to find how easily people could pick it up. The truth is, we can all tell stories, and given the right context, we can all tune into the wisdom inside us. I teach people how to come to that place of utter mystery in themselves, to be a willing servant of the unknown, transparent to the beauty and wonder within.\r\n\r\n<strong>I was a trainer of Nonviolent Communication (NVC)</strong> from 2003 until 2012, certified by the international Centre for NVC. I offered hundreds of trainings and private sessions in that modality.  That experience has helped me to offer intuitive storytelling trainings and private sessions with an appropriate level of care and sensitivity.\r\n\r\n<strong>More about me?</strong> I play several musical instruments, including the accordion. I met my wife Sundara at a musical event where were both playing our accordions. Within a few seconds of meeting we had discovered that we both shared an unusual passion for a particular album of a little-known Portuguese band! To this day, we still play accordion duets of songs from that album.\r\n\r\n<strong>Sundara drew the illustration on the home page,</strong> and we are currently writing songs together which we hope will one day weave in and out of the stories I tell. We live in Gloucestershire, England with our two children, Luke and Lara.\r\n\r\n<strong>Sign up to my list now,</strong> and get your first free story.','About Leo Sofer','','publish','closed','closed','','about-leo-sofer','','','2015-10-02 16:39:49','2015-10-02 16:39:49','',0,'http://sjh.tthtesting.co.uk/?page_id=16',14,'page','',0),(17,1,'2015-09-28 12:32:25','2015-09-28 12:32:25','','About','','inherit','closed','closed','','16-revision-v1','','','2015-09-28 12:32:25','2015-09-28 12:32:25','',16,'http://sjh.tthtesting.co.uk/16-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(18,1,'2015-09-28 12:32:38','2015-09-28 12:32:38','Contact Leo using the form below: \r\n\r\n[contact-form-7 id=\"2058\" title=\"Contact Form\"]','Contact','','publish','closed','closed','','contact','','','2016-01-11 18:08:39','2016-01-11 18:08:39','',0,'http://sjh.tthtesting.co.uk/?page_id=18',16,'page','',0),(19,1,'2015-09-28 12:32:38','2015-09-28 12:32:38','','Contact','','inherit','closed','closed','','18-revision-v1','','','2015-09-28 12:32:38','2015-09-28 12:32:38','',18,'http://sjh.tthtesting.co.uk/18-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(29,1,'2015-09-28 12:35:51','2015-09-28 12:35:51','','Home','','publish','closed','closed','','29','','','2015-10-02 16:45:38','2015-10-02 16:45:38','',0,'http://sjh.tthtesting.co.uk/?p=29',1,'nav_menu_item','',0),(31,1,'2015-09-28 12:35:51','2015-09-28 12:35:51',' ','','','publish','closed','closed','','31','','','2015-10-02 16:45:38','2015-10-02 16:45:38','',0,'http://sjh.tthtesting.co.uk/?p=31',2,'nav_menu_item','',0),(32,1,'2015-09-28 12:35:51','2015-09-28 12:35:51',' ','','','publish','closed','closed','','32','','','2015-10-02 16:45:38','2015-10-02 16:45:38','',0,'http://sjh.tthtesting.co.uk/?p=32',3,'nav_menu_item','',0),(33,1,'2015-09-28 12:35:51','2015-09-28 12:35:51',' ','','','publish','closed','closed','','33','','','2015-10-02 16:45:39','2015-10-02 16:45:39','',0,'http://sjh.tthtesting.co.uk/?p=33',7,'nav_menu_item','',0),(34,1,'2015-09-28 12:35:51','2015-09-28 12:35:51','','About','','publish','closed','closed','','34','','','2015-10-02 16:45:39','2015-10-02 16:45:39','',0,'http://sjh.tthtesting.co.uk/?p=34',8,'nav_menu_item','',0),(35,1,'2015-09-28 12:35:51','2015-09-28 12:35:51',' ','','','publish','closed','closed','','35','','','2015-10-02 16:45:39','2015-10-02 16:45:39','',0,'http://sjh.tthtesting.co.uk/?p=35',9,'nav_menu_item','',0),(39,1,'2015-10-01 12:57:39','2015-10-01 12:57:39','','background-stars','','inherit','open','closed','','background-stars','','','2015-10-01 12:57:39','2015-10-01 12:57:39','',0,'http://sjh.tthtesting.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/background-stars.jpg',0,'attachment','image/jpeg',0),(40,1,'2015-10-01 15:19:13','2015-10-01 15:19:13','','background-stars','','inherit','open','closed','','background-stars-2','','','2015-10-01 15:19:13','2015-10-01 15:19:13','',0,'http://sjh.tthtesting.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/background-stars1.jpg',0,'attachment','image/jpeg',0),(43,1,'2015-10-02 10:28:03','2015-10-02 10:28:03','','Stories of the Journey Home','','inherit','closed','closed','','5-revision-v1','','','2015-10-02 10:28:03','2015-10-02 10:28:03','',5,'http://sjh.tthtesting.co.uk/archives/43',0,'revision','',0),(44,1,'2015-10-02 10:28:23','2015-10-02 10:28:23','','New Here?','','inherit','closed','closed','','10-revision-v1','','','2015-10-02 10:28:23','2015-10-02 10:28:23','',10,'http://sjh.tthtesting.co.uk/archives/44',0,'revision','',0),(45,1,'2015-10-02 10:29:16','2015-10-02 10:29:16','','Blog','','inherit','closed','closed','','14-revision-v1','','','2015-10-02 10:29:16','2015-10-02 10:29:16','',14,'http://sjh.tthtesting.co.uk/archives/45',0,'revision','',0),(46,1,'2015-10-02 10:29:49','2015-10-02 10:29:49','','Services','','publish','closed','closed','','services','','','2015-12-15 12:55:53','2015-12-15 12:55:53','',0,'http://sjh.tthtesting.co.uk/?page_id=46',10,'page','',0),(47,1,'2015-10-02 10:29:49','2015-10-02 10:29:49','','Trainings','','inherit','closed','closed','','46-revision-v1','','','2015-10-02 10:29:49','2015-10-02 10:29:49','',46,'http://sjh.tthtesting.co.uk/archives/47',0,'revision','',0),(48,1,'2015-10-02 15:55:46','2015-10-02 15:55:46','<strong>We live in a culture with a dysfunctional mythology.</strong> Many of the stories that now surround us convey messages about life, and about ourselves, that are anything but life-serving.

Do any of these strike a chord with you?\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>You do not want to buy into the consumerism and materialism that surrounds you.</strong> Everyone seems to be obsessed with looks, and status, and money, and success, and you don\'t want to be a slave to those things. But sometimes it\'s a challenge to stay in touch with your own inherent value. You want to know your own worth regardless of what others think, and find a truer way of evaluating your identity and purpose.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>You worry at the way the world is speeding up, all in the name of efficiency and \"progress\".</strong> The more wizzy our gadgets get, the more frazzled our nervous systems become. Everyone seems to be racing to keep up, survival is now all about doing things faster and faster. You don\'t want to be swept up in all this over-stimulation, and yet it\'s not always easy. You have a deep longing for peace and stillness inside, and every time you are brought back there, you remember how essential it is to your wellbeing.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Your heart aches at how human beings have seperated themselves from nature</strong> and now dominate, exploit and pollute the world we all share. We are now even told that we might be all alone in the universe. You know in your bones that this isn\'t the true picture and we don\'t need to live this way. You carry a vision of interconnection that you long to see reflected in the culture around you, in which we care for the world around us, and know our intimate connection to the cosmos.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>You\'ve been given the idea that the thing you are most longing for is out there somewhere,</strong> in relationships, in possesions, in accomplishments. Chasing after these things has started to feel wearisome, however, and you recognise that it\'s time to stop. You feel sad at how much of your life energy you\'ve been losing in this way. You want to bring yourself more fully to the here and now, and to cultivate appreciation and gratitude for what is actually present in your life.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>You were taught early on to repress your pain and the habit stuck for a long time,</strong> especially as most people around you seemed to be doing the same. But now you notice there are some areas of your life where you feel shut down and numb. Turning and facing what\'s dark and difficult in youself isn\'t easy, but you know it is essential. You want the courage and support to face reality fully, so that the sweet flow of love can bless your life and all your relationships.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>You can\'t seem to shake the belief that there\'s something fundamentally wrong with you.</strong> Sometimes you can feel ashamed and small, and in those moments you notice yourself shrinking from life and trying to hide. You know that this belief is false, but it goes so deep that you need reminding again and again of the truth: there is absolutely nothing wrong with you, and in your essense you are a radiant divine being, whole and complete in every way.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<strong>The stories we hear speak directly to our subconscious mind,</strong> and help us form a map of reality by which we navigate. Wouldn\'t you want the stories you hear to affirm life-serving values, and help you orient towards your heart\'s desire?\r\n\r\n<strong>People who can best benefit from this work include...</strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>helping professionals and people working in the healing arts</li>\r\n	<li>artists, musicians, actors and writers</li>\r\n	<li>communicators, public speakers, teachers, leaders and educators</li>\r\n	<li>people who practice meditation or other self development practices</li>\r\n	<li>people struggling with illness, anxiety or emotional distress</li>\r\n	<li>parents, and elders</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<strong>who...</strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>value being in touch with their emotions</li>\r\n	<li>want to live whole-heartedly and courageously</li>\r\n	<li>feel a connection to the sacred</li>\r\n	<li>are dreaming of a different future, a better world</li>\r\n	<li>wish to create a new and healthier culture</li>\r\n	<li>want to live in harmony with nature, respecting all life</li>\r\n	<li>have a willingnesss to face their shadows, and move beyond the limitations of their conditioning</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<strong>Sometimes inner work can seem like so much hard work.</strong> How much easier to be taken by the hand and led inside by a story!

Where were the stories celebrating the limitless potential I was glimpsing inside?\r\n\r\n<strong>After some searching I discovered mythology,</strong> and found that human beings weren\'t as strange as I had thought. We had always had stories about the inner life, and those stories had often been central to the cultures that had come before us. What was strange was the way the modern world had turned its back on all that.\r\n\r\n<strong>I spent several years studying European folktales</strong> and became a storyteller. I wanted to learn in-depth the ways we used to enchant one another with stories. I gave over two thousand storytelling performances in hundreds of schools throughout England. But then, something really unexpected happened...\r\n\r\n<strong>The stories started coming by themselves!</strong> As I saw vivid scenes progressing in my mind\'s eye, and heard verbal cues from my inner voice, new stories that were both magical and surprising would come tumbling out of me! Although I never knew what was coming next, I was amazed to find that the stories were well structured and had a beautiful and uplifting teaching.\r\n\r\n<strong>Telling these stories is like standing at the edge of a mysterious ocean</strong> of wonder and depth and great beauty. I throw open my arms and wait, and the stories that come are utterly unknown to me. My job is only to find the words for what I\'m receiving.\r\n\r\n<strong>I\'ve recorded thousands of these \"intuitive stories\" in the last 20 years.</strong> I\'ve told them to my own kids, and for audiences of both adults and children in many diverse settings. The stories adapt to whoever is listening, and respond to the needs that are present, in a way that continues to amaze me.\r\n\r\n<strong>In 2010 I began teaching Intuitive Storytelling,</strong> and was surprised to find how easily people could pick it up. The truth is, we can all tell stories, and given the right context, we can all tune into the wisdom inside us. I teach people how to come to that place of utter mystery in themselves, to be a willing servant of the unknown, transparent to the beauty and wonder within.\r\n\r\n<strong>I was a trainer of Nonviolent Communication (NVC)</strong> from 2003 until 2012, certified by the international Centre for NVC. I offered hundreds of trainings and private sessions in that modality.  That experience has helped me to offer intuitive storytelling trainings and private sessions with an appropriate level of care and sensitivity.\r\n\r\n<strong>More about me?</strong> I play several musical instruments, including the accordion. I met my wife Sundara at a musical event where were both playing our accordions. Within a few seconds of meeting we had discovered that we both shared an unusual passion for a particular album of a little-known Portuguese band! To this day, we still play accordion duets of songs from that album.\r\n\r\n<strong>Sundara drew the illustration on the home page,</strong> and we are currently writing songs together which we hope will one day weave in and out of the stories I tell. We live in Gloucestershire, England with our two children, Luke and Lara.\r\n\r\n<strong>Sign up to my list now,</strong> and get your first free story.','About Leo Sofer','','inherit','closed','closed','','16-revision-v1','','','2015-10-02 16:39:49','2015-10-02 16:39:49','',16,'http://sjh.tthtesting.co.uk/archives/58',0,'revision','',0),(59,1,'2015-10-02 16:40:28','2015-10-02 16:40:28',' ','','','publish','closed','closed','','59','','','2015-10-02 16:45:38','2015-10-02 16:45:38','',12,'http://sjh.tthtesting.co.uk/?p=59',4,'nav_menu_item','',0),(60,1,'2015-10-02 16:40:28','2015-10-02 16:40:28',' ','','','publish','closed','closed','','60','','','2015-10-02 16:45:39','2015-10-02 16:45:39','',12,'http://sjh.tthtesting.co.uk/?p=60',5,'nav_menu_item','',0),(61,1,'2015-10-02 16:44:33','2015-10-02 16:44:33','','Storytelling','','inherit','closed','closed','','12-revision-v1','','','2015-10-02 16:44:33','2015-10-02 16:44:33','',12,'http://sjh.tthtesting.co.uk/archives/61',0,'revision','',0),(62,1,'2015-10-02 16:45:01','2015-10-02 16:45:01',' ','','','publish','closed','closed','','62','','','2015-10-02 16:45:39','2015-10-02 16:45:39','',0,'http://sjh.tthtesting.co.uk/?p=62',6,'nav_menu_item','',0),(63,1,'2015-10-06 13:07:55','2015-10-06 13:07:55','','story-tree-content','','inherit','open','closed','','story-tree-content','','','2015-10-06 13:07:55','2015-10-06 13:07:55','',0,'http://sjh.tthtesting.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/story-tree-content.jpg',0,'attachment','image/jpeg',0),(65,1,'2015-10-06 14:51:15','2015-10-06 14:51:15','<strong>In the modern age, the mythic core of our culture has collapsed.</strong> In the last few hundred years we\'ve done away with most of the old stories that we previously lived by.
